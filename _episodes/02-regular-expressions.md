## Describing text to computers

Regular expressions are the language ...

> ## Fruit data
> Vectors and text...
> How many fruit?
{: .challenge}

## How to find a fruit

Compare with Find in Excel
Want to find 'apple', how can R help us - `str_detect()`

> ## Kicking the str_detect tyres
> Run the following commands, what is the output and why?
> (match multiple with full words, match a substring, fail to match with capitals, throw in a space?)
> Write a str_detect command to find these fruits:
{:. challenge}

## Not just exact matches

The power in regular expressions comes from...

> ## Specific currants
> In words, how could we find just the 'blackcurrant' and 'redcurrant' from the fruits, while not detecting the plain 'currant'? 

## Wildcards

regex patterns have many special characters that are not matched exactly..

'.currant'
