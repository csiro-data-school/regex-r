## Why is data messy
It is very rare for a data file to be perfectly tidy and ready to work with when you first recieve
it. Data is frequently collected in a way that makes it easy to record, rather than in a way that
makes it easy to analyse later on.

Manual data entry or changed collection formats can both result in data inconsistencies that need
to be standardised. Even automated data collection can have problems when the data is recorded in a
way that is easy for computers to understand, but difficult for humans. These problems can be 
particularly obvious with text based data which is often far less consistently structured than
numeric data.

> **Don't** open the file in Excel, because it will try to automatically format some of the data columns.

## Computer cleaning
Computers can help tidying up text data just like with numeric data. All we need to do is provide 
precise instructions that describe how to work with our text data. By writing these steps down in 
code, we gain the usual benefits of scripting our analysis -- there is a written record of our process
that can be reviewed, and our instructions can be repeated in the future on the same or new datasets.

When working with text, we talk about 'patterns' that can be used for searching within a text string.
Consider a calendar date written down, say, 23/8/2014. We all recognise a date as being a date when 
we see one written down this way. Why? Because thereâ€™s a consistent pattern to it. We could describe
the pattern of a date written this way as: one or two digits, a forward slash, one or two digits, a
forward slash, then either 2 digits or 4 digits. Using that pattern of what a date looks like, we 
can identify other dates in text even if they are not exactly the same.

> ## Using patterns to describe text
> Consider the following list of words:
> 
> * Thursday
> * birthday
> * Anzac Day
> * Tuesday
> * sunday
> * Christmas Day
>
> Can you describe a pattern that would uniquely specify the following pairs of words from the list: 
> 
> 1. "Thursday" and "Tuesday"
> 2. "sunday" and "birthday"
> 3. "Anzac Day" and "Christmas Day"
>
> > ## Solution
> > A possible solution:
> > 
> > 1. Items starting with "T"
> > 2. Items starting with a lower case letter
> > 3. Items with a space
